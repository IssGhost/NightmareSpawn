Player Movement Research:

In this project, I’m exploring how player movement impacts gameplay in my horror dungeon game. 
The way players navigate the dungeon whether they’re sneaking, sprinting, or avoiding traps—can make or break their experience. 
I’m using data to see how movement affects survival and immersion in a horror setting, focusing on things like speed, precision, and strategic positioning.
