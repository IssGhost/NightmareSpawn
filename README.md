# Nightmare Spawn

### Description
Colton Richard, Ryan Kerlick, Victor Lopez, David Castillo

This project is a **Godot 4.3-based dungeon crawler** where players explore rooms, search for loot, and battle enemies. Each floor concludes with a Boss Room. Defeating the boss allows players to progress to the next floor in an endless cycle of increasingly difficult challenges until the player is defeated.

The game is designed for gamers familiar with challenging gameplay, but there's enough room for novices to learn and adapt. Our team has always been intrigued by this genre, and the project offers an opportunity to delve into game development and refine our git collaboration skills.

## Setup
### Requirements:
- Godot 4.3
- Aseprite (for modifying sprites)
- Jira and Bitbucket for project management and version control

### Installation:
1. Clone the project repository from Bitbucket: `git clone https://clr269@bitbucket.org/cs3398-miranda-f24/project.git`
2. Open the project in Godot 4.3
3. Run the project to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.

## Usage
- **Movement**: Use the arrow keys or WASD to navigate through the dungeon rooms.
- **Combat**: Attack enemies with the assigned keys, dodge, and use special abilities when available.
- **Objective**: Defeat the boss of each floor to progress.

## Project Status
The project is currently **in progress**. Core mechanics like player movement and boss fights are implemented, while additional levels, enemy types, and loot are under development.

## Room for Improvement
- More enemy types and behaviors to enhance gameplay variety.
- Additional player abilities and power-ups.
- Improve room generation to allow for more complex and engaging dungeon layouts.

To do:
- Implement a save/load system.
- Add difficulty scaling for advanced players.
